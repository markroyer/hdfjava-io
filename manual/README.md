# HdfJavaIO Documentation

The TeX document in this directory describes the HdfJavaIO library
that allows Java developers to read and write HDF5 files in the Octave
HDF5 format.

## Requirements

The TeX document requires beramono.sty which is found in the
`texlive-fonts-extra` package on Debian-based Linux systems.

The build also requires jurabib to be installed.  The jurabib is also
found in the `texlive-bibtex-extra` package on Debian-based Linux
systems.

## Building

To create the PDF, just type

```
make
```

at the command line.

Typing

```
make clean
```

will get rid of miscellaneous TeX files.
